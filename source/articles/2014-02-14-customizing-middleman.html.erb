<p>For as long as I can remember I have always tinkered. Whether it's deconstructing my remote control cars, to building my own gaming computers. This tendancy now spills over to web development.</p>

<p>The intention of this blog post is not to be an exhaustive tutorial on customizing Middleman, instead I'll cover a few things I customized to fit my needs.</p>
