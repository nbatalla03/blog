<p>As designers, we often want to keep are work hidden from public view until we are 100% percent content with every pixel. I can certainly relate to this mindset.</p>

<h4>Do It Yourself Testing</h4>

<p>Due to the wide breadth of usability testing, I want to remove any confusion by simply focusing on "Do-It-Yourself" testing.</p>

<p>"Do-It-Yourself" testing is a form of qualitative testing. Its main purpose is to gain insight to help you improve what you are building.</p>

<p>Usability testing is not restricted to web applications only. Physical products can also benefit from usability testing.</p>

<h4>Testing Early</h4>

<p>Imagine you are building a gigantic Lego castle and you are triumphantly placing the last Lego piece on your castle's defense tower. You take a step back to marvel at it's awesomeness, only to notice that there is an #EEEEEE colored lego block conveniently located in the center of your castle's wall, when clearly you meant for it to be an #AAAAAA colored blocked.</p>

<p>So what do you do? Take it apart and swap out the erroneous block, or live with the mistake? It's these types of situations that early testing can help avoid. By testing early and testing earlier then you think necessary, you gain precious insight to help you build the correct colored castle wall.</p>

<h4>Testing Primer</h4>

<p>I'll do a more in depth blog post on how to go about doing usability testing, but for now, a quick primer.</p>

<p>Grab at least three people. You're probably wondering why three? While having more people would probably benefit your testing, our primary goal is to gain insight, also finding three participants is significantly easier than finding five.</p>

<p>Now that you have your guinea pigs. Create scripts that you want your users to accomplish. It can be as simple as signing up, reading your about page, etc... The idea here is to test the important aspects of what your are building.</p>

<p>Once you have your scripts ready to go, you now must conduct the test. Keep in mind that you are not to answer any questions that will help them accomplish the script, this task is left for them to figure out. Encourage your users to think aloud and verbalize their thoughts, these are important insights you can use to improve your product.</p>

<p>That's it for now!</p>
